/** @brief   Macro definition for diagnosing other tranmsission errors.
 *  @details When debugging CAN transmission problems, it is sometimes
 *           helpful to determine if the physical connection is the 
 *           problem, or if the problem is software-related. The 
 *           CAN_ERROR message is used to diagnose hardware problems,
 *           either with the physical CAN wires or the MCP2515. This
 *           message is used if there isn't a problem with the 
 *           physical link, but a different message was received
 *           from what the CAN task was looking for.
