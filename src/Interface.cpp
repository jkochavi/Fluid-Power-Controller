/** @file Interface.cpp
 * This file contains the function files for the RTOS
 * tasks used with the interface controller. It manages
 * three tasks: display, CAN, and hall effect. In the 
 * display task, the controller interfaces with a 
 * Nextion display using the EasyNextionLibrary header
 * file. The controller communicates with the Nextion
 * using UART. In the CAN task, the controller interfaces
 * with an MCP2515 CAN controller using SPI, which outputs
 * a CAN signal to the CAN bus. In the hall effect task,
 * the controller reads a GPIO pin using a polling method.
 * 
 * As discussed in the section, \ref s_software, the task
 * with the highest priority is task_HALL1(), which must
 * quickly poll the hall effect sensor to measure the 
 * speed of the vehicle. A high-level task diagram is
 * shown in Figure 1.

 * <br /><b>Figure 1.</b> Inter-controller system boundary diagram.
 *
 * The sensor task, task_HALL1() operates in a simple 
 * Finite State Machine (FSM) that switches states
 * based on the high/low status of the hall effect signal. An
 * FSM diagram is shown in the figure below.

 * <br /><b>Figure 2.</b> FSM diagram for task_HALL1().
 * 
 * In State 1, the task continuously waits for a hall effect trigger. Since
 * the sensor is active-low, the task uses the function debounce() to identify
 * when the signal transitions from high to low. When this change is identified,
 * the task calculates the speed of the vehicle and stores it in two inter-task
 * variables: bikeSpeed and floatSpeed. See variable descriptions for more 
 * information. After the speed is calculated, the task transitions to State 2
 * to wait until the signal transitions back to high. When the signal returns
 * from low to high, the task transitions back to State 1 to wait for the next
 * pulse.

 *           by 10, and then the Nextion will shift the decimal 
 *           place left by 1. For example, if task_HALL1() 
 *           were to calculate a speed of 10.52 mph, the task
 *           will first multiply by 10 and then round to the 
 *           nearest integer, which will equal 105. Then, 
 *           task_display() will send the number 105 to the Nextion.
 *           The Nextion's software will store the number 105 in 
 *           its simulated floating point number variable, with 
 *           a decimal point inserted 1 digit to the left. Thus,
 *           the screen will display: 10.5.
